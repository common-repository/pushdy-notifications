Increase engagement and drive more repeat traffic to your WordPress site with desktop push notifications. Now supporting Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

== Description ==

[Pushdy](https://www.pushdy.vn) is an easy way to increase user engagement. Use Pushdy to send visitors targeted push notifications so they keep coming back. It takes just a few minutes to install.

After setup, your visitors opt-in to receive push notifications when you publish a new post. Visitors receive these notifications even after they’ve left your website, thus driving re-engagement. 

You can configure notification delivery at preset intervals, create user segments, and customize the opt-in process for visitors.

= Features =
* **Supports Chrome** (Desktop & Android), **Safari** (Mac OS X), **Microsoft Edge** (Desktop & Android), **Opera** (Desktop & Android) and **Firefox** (Desktop & Android) on HTTPS sites.

* **Automatic Notifications** - Send notifications to followers every time you publish a new post. Or set up a reminder that gets automatically sent to them if they haven’t visited for a few days.

* **Targeting Segments** - Send notifications to specific visitors based on language, number of times they’ve visited your blog, or even set up your own user attributes that you can target.

* **Opt-In Customization** - Choose when and how to ask your visitors to opt-in to browser notifications. Customize the prompt they first see.

* **Real Time Analytics** - See your notifications being delivered in real time, and watch them as they convert into visitors.

* **A/B Testing** - Try out different messages to a smaller set of your visitors to figure out which messages are more effective and then send the more effective message to the rest of your visitors!

* **Scheduled Notifications** - Schedule notifications to be delivered in the future, based on a user’s time zone, or even based on the same time of day they last visited your website.
